# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using SVM  
A machine learning web application built using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical features.  
The app is deployed through **Streamlit** and uses the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

---
## 🎯 Objective

To develop a simple yet effective ML-based web application that predicts diabetes risk using SVM and Streamlit.

## 📌 Features
- Machine Learning model using **SVM (Linear Kernel)**
- Interactive and user-friendly **Streamlit web interface**
- Takes 8 medical input parameters
- Predicts:
  - **1 → Diabetic**
  - **0 → Not Diabetic**
- Model saved as `svm.sav` using pickle
